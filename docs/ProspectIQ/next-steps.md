**Next Steps:**

For going live and scaling, here’s what’s next:
	1.	Finalize Database Schema
	•	Build out tables beyond the example contact_table (e.g., donors, gifts, users).
	•	Apply migrations (consider Alembic).
	2.	API Expansion
	•	Add endpoints for all needed objects (CRUD for donors, gifts, users, etc).
	•	Add authentication (e.g., JWT, OAuth) if you’ll have users.
	3.	Error Handling & Logging
	•	Add structured logging and error handlers to capture bugs and audit events.
	4.	Tests
	•	Write unit and integration tests for the API.
	•	Optionally set up CI for automated tests on push.
	5.	Security Hardening
	•	Limit database and Redis access to only the App Runner VPC.
	•	Rotate keys and secrets using AWS Secrets Manager.
	6.	Monitoring & Alerts
	•	Set up AWS CloudWatch or another service for performance/error alerts.
	7.	Documentation
	•	Expand README and in-app /docs for API consumers.
	•	Document the environment variable requirements and deployment steps.
	8.	Front-End Integration
	•	(If needed) Build a front-end client (React, Next.js, etc.) to use the API.

**In summary:**
You have a working, cloud-native Python API stack running on AWS. Your infrastructure is solid; next, focus on feature development, security, and automation!
